# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio â€” my **"first"** website built with Angular. Itâ€™s a learning project to try things out and experiment. ðŸš€

### Progress So Far  
Thereâ€™s still a lot to do and a lot to learn (or re-learn). Here's the plan:

### To-Do List:  
1. **Set up hosting**  
   - Get a server and domain from DigitalOcean.  
   - Configure the server and deploy the website.  

2. **Learn Angular**  
   - Complete a few Angular tutorials to sharpen my skills.  

3. **Prototype**  
   - Create a basic (and probably ugly) website to run some tests.  

4. **Improve Design**  
   - Make it more visually appealing.  
   - Add content such as:  
     - Photos  
     - Educational background  
     - Descriptions of my projects  
     - "About Me" section (e.g., who I am, why I love coding, etc.).  

5. **Integrate GitHub API**  
   - Use the GitHub API to dynamically display my projects.

This is a work in progress, and Iâ€™m excited to see how it evolves! ðŸŽ‰
