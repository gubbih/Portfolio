day 1:
I been at it learning angular for an hours now, and im starting to get it, its very famaliar to jetpack compose with some of the things
im also going typescript with angular to keep it nice and clean.
at the moment im not sure about the design of my website but im thinking of getting some inspecration on the internet and look for cool designs
I got a domain at gubih.xyz and im ready with getting a server up and running when the website is at a stable state, nothing to show yet but there will be soon.
This might take some time since i am used to work backend and not frontend, this will be a nice challenge
